Notebooks Guide

- Notebooks are now grouped by topic: `preprocessing/`, `modeling/`, `backtesting/`, and `misc/`.
- New notebooks should live in the appropriate subfolder with clear, semantic names (e.g., `preprocessing/030_feature_engineering.ipynb`).
- Prefer importing from `src/` instead of embedding large code blocks in notebooks.
- Keep outputs minimal to reduce repo bloat and diffs.
